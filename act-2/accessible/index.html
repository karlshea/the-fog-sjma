        NOTE: If you are trying to view the live scene and ended up here
        instead, this is because your screen size is indicative of a device
        using touch controls and this project only works with mouse/track-pad,
        and keyboard. If this redirect happened in error and you do have a
        mouse/track-pad and keyboard you can access the scene
        <a href="../">HERE</a>.

        Act 2 starts the viewer in a bright 3D space with the camera emulating a
        first person perspective. The scene consists of a landscape populated
        but not descript rectangular objects which imply architectural
        structures. The scene is bright with most objects and the landscape
        appearing on a spectrum between white and a middle tone gray. The viewer
        moves through the space using the mouse to look and the WASD keys to
        move through the space.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the viewer explores, texts rise up from the floor and are spoken
        aloud using the browserâ€™s built-in text to speech functionality. The
        texts are drawn from horror narratives where fog is used to define a
        scene, set tone, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire scene, while three dimensional, is rendered in very small
        ASCII characters. White characters of varying type on a black background
        generate the optical grayscale experienced by the viewer.
