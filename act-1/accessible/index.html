        NOTE: If you are trying to view the live scene and ended up here
        instead, this is because your screen size is indicative of a device
        using touch controls and this project only works with mouse/track-pad
        and keyboard. If this redirect happened in error and you do have a
        mouse/track-pad and keyboard, you can access the scene
        <a href="../">HERE</a>.

        Act 1 starts the viewer in a 3D space that is dark gray space with the
        camera focused on a light gray fog form. The viewer is able to orbit the
        camera around the fog using the mouse and pan around the scene using a
        click and drag gesture. The dark gray space of the scene churns and
        roils much like the fog object focal point. As the viewer watches, texts
        continually emerge from the fog before submerging again. The texts are
        drawn from archival documents about fog and its relationship to the
        military, science, and commerce. The dark gray background also contains
        a black spherical matrix of lines and grayscale graph images.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene also contains a simple soundscape consisting of “brown” noise
        meant to loosely mimic the ocean. This noise is punctuated by
        intermittent deep tones which are inspired by land-based fog horns that
        signal at set intervals during periods of heavy fog.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire scene, while three dimensional, is rendered in very small
        ASCII characters. White characters of varying type on a black background
        generate the optical grayscale experienced by the viewer.
