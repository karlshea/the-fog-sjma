        NOTE: If you are trying to view the live scene and ended up here
        instead, this is because your screen size is indicative of a device
        using touch controls and this project only works with mouse/track-pad,
        and keyboard. If this redirect happened in error and you do have a
        mouse/track-pad and keyboard you can access the scene
        <a href="../">HERE</a>.

        Act 3 places the viewer in a 3D space with a fixed perspective. The
        scene contains curvilinear forms that the viewer can move using a click
        and drag motion. The entire scene shifts and moves with a fog-like
        motion. Overlaid on top of the scene is a set of texts which cycle in a
        random order and all pertain to the idea of what it might be like to be
        “of the fog”. Viewers can use the curvilinear forms to reveal or obscure
        text as they desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene also contains a simple soundscape consisting of “brown” noise
        meant to loosely mimic the ocean. The entire scene, while three
        dimensional, is rendered in very small ASCII characters. White
        characters of varying type on a black background generate the optical
        grayscale experienced by the viewer.
