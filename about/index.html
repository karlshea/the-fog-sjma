      <h2 id="overview" class="about-text">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This work is comprised of 3 &quot;acts&quot; exploring our relationship
        to fog as a society and the potential for fog to serve as a positive
        role model for trans embodiment. Each act is built as a procedurally
        generated 3D space using <a href="https://threejs.org/" class="about-text">three.js</a>.
        The work has been designed as an website without ads or tracking and
        with intentionally open source code. Sustainability and accessibility
        also informed the design choices for the site.
      </p>
      <h2 id="statement" class="about-text">Statement</h2>
      <p>
        This body of work centers around the politics of knowledge making, data
        collection, and trans visibility through an exploration of fog as a
        common subject/trope of horror narratives as well as metaphor used in
        military strategy. The questions driving this work include:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Why has fog been figured as a menace in the popular imagination? Can
          fog be an aspirational figure for trans embodiment and resistance?
          What would embodiment styled after fog feel and look like?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Drawing on work by Susan Stryker (<a
          href="https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Stryker-My-Words-to-VF.pdf" class="about-text"
          >My Words To Victor Frankenstein…</a
        >) around the idea of trans identity and the monstrous, the work
        questions how subjects are perceived as monstrous and what the process
        says about the societies that produce them. Instead of investing in
        assimilation as a goal, this work seeks to imagine new trans futures
        constructed outside of cis-centric models of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work makes extensive use of ASCII art stylization. This style is
        used to break away from an emphasis on graphic fidelity as an indicator
        of quality.value, to further accentuate the computational nature of the
        scenes, and because of the way ASCII art changes subtly across browsers
        and resists standardize documentation via screenshot.

      <p>
        This project has been separated into 3 acts. I am calling them
        &quot;acts&quot; because each composition has been structured as a stage
        of sorts, each with its own mode of interaction and set of relational
        elements. Some elements in each act are procedurally generated, meaning
        that their shape, position, content, or other features are generated via
        code every time the page is loaded. This allows the work to have an
        element of controlled randomness which I find useful for creating these
        stages meant for contemplation over narrative. Each act focuses on a
        different aspect of the fog research:

        From foghorns to the “fog of war” to military efforts to disperse fog,
        the phenomenon has long been at odds with militaristic and capitalistic
        ideas of progress and control. In obscuring coasts, roads, and runways,
        fog denies us the situational awareness upon which so much of
        contemporary life is built. In its denial of ocular slight, fog
        highlights the value we place on seeing as knowing and opens up space to
        consider who gets to see and to what ends do they use that sight?
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene is viewed using an orbiting camera similar to those found in
        3D modeling and map software. The audio in this scene mimics (in a
        digital and distorted fashion) the sound of fog horns on the coast. The
        texts for this scene are drawn from scientific papers about fog
        dispersal, military texts about the fog or war, and economic texts about
        fog&#39;s negative impact. Taken together, these elements are meant to
        render fog as a subject to be scrutinized.
      </p>

      <p>
        As both trope and figure itself, fog has featured prominently across
        horror narratives as landscape, harbinger, co-conspirator, and monster.
        Whether drifting through tombstones in a graveyard, engulfing a fearful
        protagonist, or spawning inexplicable horrors, our fear of the unknown
        is often made manifest by fog. This too exposes the value we place on
        seeing as knowing and offers us the opportunity to relish in the unknown
        and unseeable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene is viewed using controls similar to those found in
        contemporary 3D video games. The ground and sky are churning masses of
        fog with the dark mass in the sky vacillating between figure and ground
        as the camera moves through the space. Texts drawn from horror
        narratives featuring fog arise out of the ground in random places and
        are uttered in a low and slurring voice as the texts rise into the fog.
        The space is also populated by rectilinear building like forms which,
        unlike the fog masses and texts, are impacted by another layer of
        computational fog. The resulting effect is that of an abandoned yet
        alive space.
      </p>
      <h3 id="act-3" class="about-text"><a href="../act-3/" class="desktop-link">Act 3</a></h3>
      <h3 id="act-3" class="about-text"><a href="../act-3/accessible/" class="mobile-link">Act 3</a></h3>
      <p>
        As something both visible and obscuring, considering fog as a positive
        model of being in the world opens up new pathways for being in the world
        as a trans person. Might I, as a trans person, be seen for who I am yet
        still with the right and power of obscurity? As fog resists the logic of
        seeing as knowing, might being like fog open up a space for feeling as
        knowing or being as knowing? To be in the world as fog is: ephemeral yet
        seen, visible yet difficult to capture, known yet expanding the
        possibilities of the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene is the only one in which the viewer can actively alter the
        objects in the space. Featuring cycling texts written by me, which must
        be exposed by moving fog sections, this final act offers provocations
        for imagining new and radically different ways of being trans in the
        world.
